                Roy L. Clay is a computer science pioneer who was dubbed the “Godfather of Silicon Valley.” He is best known for developing new software for Hewlett-Packard (HP) computers. Over 50 years, Clay has played a huge role in computer science development and has paved the way for other African-Americans in the industry.
